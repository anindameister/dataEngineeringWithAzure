#### This is data engineering with azure Project 2
# Task 1: Create your Azure resources
- Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Create an Azure Synapse workspace. Note that if you've previously created a Synapse Workspace, you do not need to create a second one specifically for the project.
- Use the built-in serverless SQL pool and database within the Synapse workspace

# Solution
- Task 1 is just easy peesy, considering what have I been doing all this while

# Task 2: Design a star schema
- You are being provided a relational schema that describes the data as it exists in PostgreSQL. 
![relational schema that describes the data as it exists in PostgreSQL](https://github.com/anindameister/dataEngineeringWithAzure/blob/main/divvy-erd.png)

            - rideable_type (string)
            - started_at (datetime)
            - ended_at (datetime)
            <!-- The Trip table's foreign keys start_station_id and end_station_id are mentioned as INT in your text, but given they reference Station(station_id) which is a VARCHAR, the data types should match. Therefore, the foreign keys should also be of type VARCHAR to correctly reference the primary key of the Station table. -->
            - start_station_id (varchar FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Station(station_id)) 
            - end_station_id (varchar FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Station(station_id)) 
            <!-- The foreign key in the Trip table should be rider_id, not member_id, to match the rider_id primary key in the Rider table according to the diagram. -->
            - member_id (INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Rider(rider_id)) 

 - DimRider(rider_id),DimAccount(account_number),DimPayment(payment_id),DimStation(station_id),DimTrip(trip_id)
 - rider_id, account_number, payment_id, station_id, and trip_id would serve as primary keys in their respective dimension tables. These primary keys uniquely identify rows in each dimension table and would then be used as foreign keys in a central fact table, linking the fact table to each of the dimension tables. This setup allows for efficient querying and analysis of the data across different dimensions.

        - trip_id (INT)
        <!-- Ensure the data types for start_station_id and end_station_id in FactRental match the data type of station_id in DimStation (which should be VARCHAR, not INT as currently listed) for proper relational integrity. -->
        - start_station_id (INT)
        - end_station_id (INT)

Based on your descriptions, Task 2, which involves designing a star schema using fact and dimension tables, appears to have been conceptually addressed with the definition of your dimension tables (DimRider, DimAccount, DimPayment, DimStation, DimTrip) and your fact table (FactRental). This schema aligns with the principles of a star schema for data warehousing, focusing on a central fact table related to multiple dimension tables that describe various entities.

    - SSL mode determines the level of security for a connection to a PostgreSQL database, specifying whether the connection should use SSL encryption and how strictly to enforce it.
- Execute the script in a command line or terminal to load data into your PostgreSQL database.
- Ensure Python is installed on your machine and you're in the directory containing the script.
- Verify Data Upload:(done)
    - Use pgAdmin or another PostgreSQL tool to check that the data from all four files has been correctly uploaded to your PostgreSQL database.
- This task simulates setting up an OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) system environment in PostgreSQL, replicating a production scenario for data usage.

# Task 4
- Task 4: EXTRACT the data from PostgreSQL

- In your Azure Synapse workspace, you will use the ingest wizard to create a one-time pipeline that ingests the data from PostgreSQL into Azure Blob Storage. This will result in all four tables being represented as text files in Blob Storage, ready for loading into the data warehouse.

Certainly! Let's go through the steps one by one:

1. **Create an Azure Synapse Workspace**:
   - Go to the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com)
   - Click on "Create a resource"
   - Search for "Azure Synapse Analytics"
   - Click "Create"
   - Provide the required details (Resource group, Workspace name, Region, etc.)
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create"

2. **Create a PostgreSQL Database within Azure**:
   - In the Azure Portal, click "Create a resource"
   - Search for "Azure Database for PostgreSQL"
   - Click "Create"
   - Provide the required details (Resource group, Server name, Location, etc.)
   - Set up the administrator user and password
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create"

3. **Create an Azure Blob Storage**:
   - In the Azure Portal, click "Create a resource"
   - Search for "Storage account"
   - Click "Create"
   - Provide the required details (Resource group, Storage account name, Location, etc.)
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create"

4. **Create a Linked Service between Blob Storage and PostgreSQL**:
   - Open your Azure Synapse Workspace
   - Go to the "Manage" hub
   - Under "External connections," click "Linked services"
   - Click "New"
   - Search for the desired connector (e.g., "Azure Blob Storage" or "PostgreSQL")
   - Select the connector and provide the required connection details
   - Click "Create"

5. **Locate the Serverless SQL Pool in Azure Synapse and Upload the Data Files**:
   - In your Azure Synapse Workspace, go to the "Develop" hub
   - Expand the "SQL script" section on the left
   - Click on the "+" icon to create a new SQL script
   - In the script editor, use the following command to create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE YourDatabaseName;
     ```
   - Switch to the newly created database using:
     ```sql
     USE YourDatabaseName;
     ```
   - Use the `OPENROWSET` function to import data from the PostgreSQL database into your Synapse SQL tables. For example:
     ```sql
     CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE YourTableName
     WITH (
         LOCATION = 'https://yourblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/path/to/data/',
         DATA_SOURCE = YourLinkedServiceName,
         FILE_FORMAT = TextFileFormat
     )
     AS
     SELECT *
     FROM OPENROWSET(
         BULK 'path/to/data/file.txt',
         DATA_SOURCE = 'YourLinkedServiceName',
         FORMAT = 'CSV'
     ) AS DataFile;
     ```
   - Replace `YourTableName`, `YourLinkedServiceName`, and the file paths with your actual values.

Make sure to replace the placeholders (e.g., `YourDatabaseName`, `YourTableName`, `YourLinkedServiceName`, file paths) with your actual values throughout the process.

After completing these steps, you should have your PostgreSQL data ingested into Azure Blob Storage and loaded into the Serverless SQL Pool within your Azure Synapse Workspace.

In the SQL statement you provided:

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE YourTableName
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'https://yourblobstorage.blob.core.windows.net/path/to/data/',
    DATA_SOURCE = YourLinkedServiceName,
    FILE_FORMAT = TextFileFormat
)
AS
SELECT *
FROM OPENROWSET(
    BULK 'path/to/data/file.txt',
    DATA_SOURCE = 'YourLinkedServiceName',
    FORMAT = 'CSV'
) AS DataFile;
```

The data files are not being uploaded directly. Instead, this statement is creating an external table in your Serverless SQL Pool that points to the data files already stored in your Azure Blob Storage.

To upload the data files to Azure Blob Storage, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Create a container in your Azure Blob Storage**:
   - In the Azure Portal, go to your Azure Blob Storage account.
   - Click on "Containers" and then "+ Container" to create a new container.
   - Provide a name for the container and set the appropriate access level.

2. **Upload the data files to the container**:
   - Once the container is created, click on it to open it.
   - Click "Upload" to upload your data files to the container.
   - You can upload files individually or in bulk.

3. **Get the path to the data files**:
   - After uploading the files, you need to get the full path to each file.
   - The path will be in the format: `https://yourstorageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net/containername/filename.txt`

4. **Update the SQL statement**:
   - In the SQL statement you provided, replace `'path/to/data/file.txt'` with the actual path to your data file in Azure Blob Storage.
   - Also, replace `'YourLinkedServiceName'` with the name of the linked service you created between Azure Synapse and Azure Blob Storage.

5. **Execute the SQL statement**:
   - Run the SQL statement in your Serverless SQL Pool to create the external table pointing to the data files in Azure Blob Storage.

After executing the SQL statement, you should have an external table in your Serverless SQL Pool that can query and access the data files stored in Azure Blob Storage.

Note: If you have multiple data files, you'll need to create an external table for each file or use a wildcard to match multiple files (e.g., `'path/to/data/*.txt'`).


# Task 5
Task 5: LOAD the data into external tables in the data warehouse
Once in Blob storage, the files will be shown in the data lake node in the Synapse Workspace. From here, you can use the script-generating function to load the data from blob storage into external staging tables in the data warehouse you created using the serverless SQL Pool.

Sure, here are the steps to load the data from Azure Blob Storage into external tables in the data warehouse using the serverless SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics:

1. **Open the Synapse Studio**:
   - In the Azure Portal, navigate to your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
   - Click on "Open Synapse Studio" to launch the Synapse Studio.

2. **Create a database in the serverless SQL pool**:
   - In the Synapse Studio, go to the "Develop" hub.
   - Expand the "SQL script" section on the left.
   - Click on the "+" icon to create a new SQL script.
   - In the script editor, use the following command to create a new database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE YourDatabaseName;
     ```
   - Switch to the newly created database using:
     ```sql
     USE YourDatabaseName;
     ```

3. **Create external data sources**:
   - In the Synapse Studio, go to the "Manage" hub.
   - Under "External connections," click "Linked services."
   - Create a new linked service to connect to your Azure Blob Storage account.

4. **Create external file formats**:
   - In the "Develop" hub, expand the "External resources" section on the left.
   - Right-click on "File formats" and select "New file format."
   - Provide a name for the file format (e.g., `TextFileFormat`).
   - Configure the file format settings based on your data files (delimiter, row terminator, etc.).

5. **Create external tables**:
   - In the "Develop" hub, expand the "External resources" section on the left.
   - Right-click on "Data sources" and select "New data source."
   - Select the linked service you created for Azure Blob Storage.
   - Right-click on "External tables" and select "Create external table."
   - Provide a name for the external table.
   - In the "Select objects" dialog, browse to the location of your data files in Azure Blob Storage.
   - Select the file(s) you want to load and click "Import."
   - In the "Create external table" dialog, configure the external table settings:
     - Select the appropriate file format.
     - Provide a table schema or use the "Import schema" option if available.
     - Click "Create and wait" to create the external table.

6. **Load data into the external tables**:
   - In the "Develop" hub, create a new SQL script.
   - Use a `SELECT` statement to query the data from the external table:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM YourExternalTableName;
     ```
   - Optionally, you can create internal tables in the serverless SQL pool and insert the data from the external tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE YourInternalTableName (
         -- Define the table schema here
     );

     INSERT INTO YourInternalTableName
     SELECT * FROM YourExternalTableName;
     ```

After following these steps, you will have successfully loaded the data from Azure Blob Storage into external tables in the serverless SQL pool of your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. You can then query or transform the data as needed.

Note: Make sure to replace `YourDatabaseName`, `YourExternalTableName`, and `YourInternalTableName` with the actual names you want to use for your database, external table, and internal table, respectively.

Sure, here are the steps to transform the data from the staging tables to the final star schema using CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT (CETAS) in the serverless SQL pool:

1. **Create a new SQL script**:
   - In the Synapse Studio, go to the "Develop" hub.
   - Expand the "SQL script" section on the left.
   - Click on the "+" icon to create a new SQL script.

2. **Define the star schema tables**:
   - In the SQL script, create the dimension and fact tables using CETAS statements.
   - For each dimension table, use a CETAS statement to select and transform the relevant data from the staging tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE DimTableName
     WITH (
         LOCATION = 'path/to/output/folder/',
         DATA_SOURCE = YourDataSourceName,
         FILE_FORMAT = YourFileFormatName
     )
     AS SELECT
         -- Select and transform columns for the dimension table
         FROM staging_tables
         -- Add any necessary filtering or transformations
     ;
     ```
   - For the fact table, use a CETAS statement to select and transform the relevant data from the staging tables, including joins with the dimension tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE FactTableName
     WITH (
         LOCATION = 'path/to/output/folder/',
         DATA_SOURCE = YourDataSourceName,
         FILE_FORMAT = YourFileFormatName
     )
     AS SELECT
         -- Select and transform columns for the fact table
         -- Join with dimension tables as needed
         FROM staging_tables
         -- Add any necessary filtering or transformations
     ;
     ```

3. **Replace placeholders with actual values**:
   - Replace `DimTableName` and `FactTableName` with the names you want to use for your dimension and fact tables, respectively.
   - Replace `'path/to/output/folder/'` with the path to the folder in your Azure Blob Storage where you want to store the output files.
   - Replace `YourDataSourceName` with the name of the linked service you created for your Azure Blob Storage account.
   - Replace `YourFileFormatName` with the name of the file format you created earlier.

4. **Execute the SQL script**:
   - Once you have defined all the CETAS statements for your star schema tables, execute the SQL script.
   - The CETAS statements will create the external table metadata and export the transformed data to the specified output folder in your Azure Blob Storage account.

5. **Verify the output**:
   - After executing the SQL script, you can navigate to the output folder in your Azure Blob Storage account to verify that the files for your star schema tables have been created.

By following these steps, you will have transformed the data from the staging tables to the final star schema using CETAS statements in the serverless SQL pool. The transformed data will be stored as external tables in your Azure Blob Storage account, which you can then query or use for further analysis.

Note: If you need to modify the star schema tables or re-run the transformations, you can simply execute the SQL script again. CETAS will overwrite the existing files in the output folder with the new transformed data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Relation between pgAdmin and PostgreSQL**:
pgAdmin is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool used to manage PostgreSQL databases. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and interacting with PostgreSQL databases, tables, users, and other objects.

PostgreSQL, on the other hand, is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is the actual database engine that stores and manages the data.

The relationship between pgAdmin and PostgreSQL is that pgAdmin acts as a client tool that connects to and interacts with the PostgreSQL database server. pgAdmin provides a visual interface for executing SQL queries, managing database objects, and performing administrative tasks on the PostgreSQL server.

2. **Inserting data into fact and dimension tables locally**:
To insert data into your fact and dimension tables based on your star schema design, you can use standard SQL `INSERT` statements in pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client tool.

Here's a general approach you can follow:

a. Create the fact and dimension tables in your PostgreSQL database using the appropriate `CREATE TABLE` statements, defining the table structure with columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.

b. Use `INSERT INTO` statements to populate the dimension tables with the relevant data. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO DimCustomer (CustomerKey, CustomerName, CustomerAddress, ...)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', '123 Main St', ...),
       (2, 'Jane Smith', '456 Oak Rd', ...),
       ...;
```

c. For the fact table, you may need to join data from multiple sources (e.g., staging tables) and perform necessary transformations. You can use a combination of `SELECT` statements with `JOIN` clauses and other SQL operations to shape the data into the desired format for the fact table.

d. Once you have the desired data set, use an `INSERT INTO` statement with a `SELECT` subquery to populate the fact table. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO FactSales (SalesKey, CustomerKey, ProductKey, SalesAmount, ...)
SELECT
    generate_series(1, 1000) AS SalesKey,
    c.CustomerKey,
    p.ProductKey,
    order_details.Quantity * order_details.UnitPrice AS SalesAmount,
    ...
FROM
    orders
    JOIN order_details ON orders.OrderID = order_details.OrderID
    JOIN DimCustomer c ON orders.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
    JOIN DimProduct p ON order_details.ProductID = p.ProductID;
```

This example assumes you have staging tables like `orders`, `order_details`, and joined data from the dimension tables `DimCustomer` and `DimProduct`.

Note that `CETAS` is an Azure Synapse Analytics feature and is not available in PostgreSQL. However, you can achieve similar functionality using standard SQL `INSERT INTO` statements with `SELECT` subqueries or `CREATE TABLE AS` statements.

3. **Analytics locally**:
While Azure Synapse Analytics provides powerful analytics capabilities in the cloud, you can still perform basic data analysis and reporting locally using PostgreSQL and various tools or programming languages.

Here are some options for local analytics:

a. **SQL queries**: You can use SQL queries in pgAdmin or any other PostgreSQL client tool to analyze and aggregate data from your fact and dimension tables. This includes using SQL functions, windowing functions, and various clauses like `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, etc.

b. **Reporting tools**: There are several open-source and commercial reporting tools that can connect to PostgreSQL databases and generate reports based on your data. Some examples include JasperReports, BIRT, and FreeReportingTool.

c. **Programming languages**: You can use programming languages like Python, R, or Java to connect to your PostgreSQL database, retrieve data, and perform data analysis and visualization. Libraries like pandas (Python), dplyr (R), or JDBC (Java) can be used for this purpose.

d. **Business Intelligence (BI) tools**: Some BI tools like Metabase, Redash, or Superset can connect to PostgreSQL databases and provide interactive dashboards, visualizations, and analytics capabilities.

While these local options may not offer the same level of performance and scalability as Azure Synapse Analytics, they can still be useful for smaller-scale data analysis and reporting tasks during the development and prototyping phases of your project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sure, I can explain how to insert data from existing tables within the same PostgreSQL database into your fact and dimension tables based on your star schema design.

Assuming you have already created the fact and dimension tables with the appropriate structure (columns, data types, primary keys, and foreign keys), you can use INSERT INTO statements with subqueries to populate these tables from the existing data in your staging or source tables.

Here's how you can approach this:

1. **Populating Dimension Tables**:
To populate a dimension table from an existing table, you can use an INSERT INTO statement with a SELECT subquery. For example, to populate the DimCustomer table from an existing Customers table:

```sql
INSERT INTO DimCustomer (CustomerKey, CustomerName, CustomerAddress, ...)
SELECT
    customer_id AS CustomerKey,
    customer_name AS CustomerName,
    customer_address AS CustomerAddress,
    ... -- Select other relevant columns
FROM
    Customers;
```

This statement selects the relevant columns from the Customers table and inserts them into the DimCustomer table, mapping the column names accordingly.

2. **Populating Fact Table**:
To populate the fact table, you typically need to join data from multiple source tables and perform necessary transformations. You can use an INSERT INTO statement with a SELECT subquery that performs the required joins and transformations.

```sql
INSERT INTO FactSales (SalesKey, CustomerKey, ProductKey, SalesAmount, ...)
SELECT
    generate_series(1, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders)) AS SalesKey,
    c.CustomerKey,
    p.ProductKey,
    od.Quantity * od.UnitPrice AS SalesAmount,
    ... -- Select other relevant columns or derived values
FROM
    Orders o
    JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
    JOIN DimCustomer c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerKey
    JOIN DimProduct p ON od.ProductID = p.ProductKey;
```

In this example:
- The `generate_series` function is used to generate sequential SalesKey values based on the number of rows in the Orders table.
- The Orders table is joined with the OrderDetails table to get the order and product details.
- The CustomerKey and ProductKey values are retrieved from the DimCustomer and DimProduct dimension tables, respectively, using joins based on the appropriate foreign key relationships.
- Derived columns like SalesAmount are calculated based on the data from the source tables.

3. **Handling Data Type Conversions**:
If the data types of the columns in the source tables do not match the data types of the corresponding columns in the destination fact or dimension tables, you may need to perform explicit data type conversions using appropriate SQL functions or CAST operations.

4. **Handling Null Values**:
Depending on your requirements, you may need to handle null values in the source data. You can use techniques like COALESCE or ISNULL functions to replace null values with appropriate default values or perform other necessary transformations.

5. **Handling Duplicates**:
If your source data contains duplicates, and you want to avoid inserting duplicate rows in the fact or dimension tables, you can use the DISTINCT keyword in the SELECT subquery or add appropriate filters or conditions to eliminate duplicates.

6. **Handling Updates and Deletes**:
If you need to update or delete data in the fact or dimension tables based on changes in the source tables, you can use UPDATE and DELETE statements with subqueries or joins to perform the necessary operations.

By following these steps, you can populate your fact and dimension tables based on your star schema design using the data from existing tables within your PostgreSQL database. Remember to adjust the SQL statements according to your specific table and column names, data types, and relationships.

now , originally, the tables were given as the snap


Now, in the fact and dimension tables the data types have been taken care off. Moreover, in the data files tables like account doesn't exist

I was very much confident about the fact and dimension tables however, I forgot to consider the business outcomes and hence please modify my fact and dimension tables based on the below business outcomes

1. Analyze how much time is spent per ride
Based on date and time factors such as day of week and time of day
Based on which station is the starting and / or ending station
Based on age of the rider at time of the ride
Based on whether the rider is a member or a casual rider
2. Analyze how much money is spent
Per month, quarter, year
Per member, based on the age of the rider at account start
3.Analyze how much money is spent per member
Based on how many rides the rider averages per month
Based on how many minutes the rider spends on a bike per month


Moreover, in the data files tables like account doesn't exist


so the account details are there within the rider table which is there in the snap
so fix all of the fact and dimension tables based on the business outcomes

Tell me what is wrong with my current table as well, moreover, also let me know if I have not mentioned a particular table

Also write full queries so that I can copy and paste. Moreover, also gives queries to get the business outcomes

- 2 fact tables

```
To fulfill the given requirement, we can create two fact tables: `FactTrip` and `FactPayment`, along with the necessary dimensions. Here's how we can structure the tables:

1. **FactTrip**

This fact table will store trip-related information, including the trip duration and the rider's age at the time of the trip.

```sql
-- Check and create external file format if not exists
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_file_formats WHERE name = 'SynapseDelimitedTextFormat')
CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
WITH (
    FORMAT_TYPE = DELIMITEDTEXT,
    FORMAT_OPTIONS (
        FIELD_TERMINATOR = ',',
        USE_TYPE_DEFAULT = FALSE
    )
)
GO

-- Check and create external data source if not exists
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net')
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net]
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'abfss://anindademo2@anindademo2.dfs.core.windows.net'
)
GO

-- Drop the external table if it exists
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.FactTrip') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    DROP EXTERNAL TABLE [dbo].[FactTrip];
END

-- Create the external table dbo.FactTrip
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dbo.FactTrip
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'FactTrip', -- Adjust the LOCATION to your actual data path
    DATA_SOURCE = [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net],
    FILE_FORMAT = [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
)
AS
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS [trip_id],
    [rider_id],
    [start_station_id],
    [end_station_id],
    [started_at],
    [ended_at],
    DATEDIFF(minute, [started_at], [ended_at]) AS [trip_duration_minutes],
    DATEDIFF(year, r.[birthday], t.[started_at]) AS [rider_age_at_trip]
FROM (
    SELECT
        tr.rider_id,
        tr.start_station_id,
        tr.end_station_id,
        tr.start_at AS [started_at],
        tr.ended_at AS [ended_at]
    FROM
        Trips tr
    JOIN Riders r ON tr.rider_id = r.rider_id
) AS SourceQuery;
GO

-- Select top 100 records to verify
SELECT TOP 100 * FROM dbo.FactTrip;
GO
```

2. **FactPayment**

This fact table will store payment-related information, including the payment amount.

```sql
-- Check and create external file format if not exists
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_file_formats WHERE name = 'SynapseDelimitedTextFormat')
CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
WITH (
    FORMAT_TYPE = DELIMITEDTEXT,
    FORMAT_OPTIONS (
        FIELD_TERMINATOR = ',',
        USE_TYPE_DEFAULT = FALSE
    )
)
GO

-- Check and create external data source if not exists
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net')
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net]
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'abfss://anindademo2@anindademo2.dfs.core.windows.net'
)
GO

-- Drop the external table if it exists
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.FactPayment') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    DROP EXTERNAL TABLE [dbo].[FactPayment];
END

-- Create the external table dbo.FactPayment
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dbo.FactPayment
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'FactPayment', -- Adjust the LOCATION to your actual data path
    DATA_SOURCE = [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net],
    FILE_FORMAT = [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
)
AS
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS [payment_id],
    [rider_id],
    [payment_date],
    [payment_amount]
FROM [dbo].[staging_Payments];
GO

-- Select top 100 records to verify
SELECT TOP 100 * FROM dbo.FactPayment;
GO
```

3. **Shared Dimensions**

Both fact tables will share the following dimensions:

- `DimRider`: This dimension table stores rider information, including their address, name, birthday, account start and end dates, and membership status.
- `DimStation`: This dimension table stores station information, including the station ID, name, latitude, and longitude.

The existing `DimRider` and `DimStation` tables can be used as shared dimensions for both fact tables.

With this structure, you can fulfill the business needs by querying the appropriate fact and dimension tables. For example, to analyze the trip duration based on various factors, you can join the `FactTrip` table with the relevant dimensions. Similarly, to analyze payment information, you can use the `FactPayment` table along with the shared dimensions.

- success criteria 2
```
The star schema should have dimensions related to the trip fact table that are related to: riders, stations, and dates. The schema should have dimensions related to the payment fact table that are related to: dates and riders.
```
- claude
```
To address the requirements for the star schema, we can create the following dimensions:

1. **Date Dimension**
This dimension will be used for both the `FactTrip` and `FactPayment` tables to analyze data based on various date and time factors such as day of the week, month, quarter, and year.

```sql
-- Check and create external file format if not exists
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_file_formats WHERE name = 'SynapseDelimitedTextFormat')
CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
WITH (
    FORMAT_TYPE = DELIMITEDTEXT,
    FORMAT_OPTIONS (
        FIELD_TERMINATOR = ',',
        USE_TYPE_DEFAULT = FALSE
    )
)
GO

CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net]
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'abfss://anindademo2@anindademo2.dfs.core.windows.net'
)
GO

-- Drop the external table if it exists
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.DimDate') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    DROP EXTERNAL TABLE [dbo].[DimDate];
END

-- Create the external table dbo.DimDate
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dbo.DimDate
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'DimDate', -- Adjust the LOCATION to your actual data path
    DATA_SOURCE = [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net],
    FILE_FORMAT = [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
)
AS
SELECT
    [date] AS [date_key],
    DATEPART(year, [date]) AS [year],
    DATEPART(quarter, [date]) AS [quarter],
    DATEPART(month, [date]) AS [month],
    DATEPART(day, [date]) AS [day],
    DATEPART(dayofyear, [date]) AS [day_of_year],
    DATEPART(week, [date]) AS [calendar_week],
    DATEPART(weekday, [date]) AS [day_of_week]
FROM (
    SELECT
        DISTINCT [date]
    FROM
        [dbo].[staging_Payments]
    UNION
    SELECT
        DISTINCT [start_at], [ended_at]
    FROM
        [dbo].[Trips]
) AS SourceQuery;
GO

-- Select top 100 records to verify
SELECT TOP 100 * FROM dbo.DimDate;
GO
```

This dimension table includes various date-related columns like year, quarter, month, day, day of the year, calendar week, and day of the week. The source data for this dimension is derived from the distinct dates present in the `staging_Payments` and `Trips` tables.

2. **Station Dimension**
This dimension will be used for the `FactTrip` table to analyze data based on the starting and ending stations.

```sql
-- Check and create external file format if not exists
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_file_formats WHERE name = 'SynapseDelimitedTextFormat')
CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
WITH (
    FORMAT_TYPE = DELIMITEDTEXT,
    FORMAT_OPTIONS (
        FIELD_TERMINATOR = ',',
        USE_TYPE_DEFAULT = FALSE
    )
)
GO

-- Check and create external data source if not exists
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net')
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net]
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'abfss://anindademo2@anindademo2.dfs.core.windows.net'
)
GO

-- Drop the external table if it exists
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.DimStation') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    DROP EXTERNAL TABLE [dbo].[DimStation];
END

-- Create the external table dbo.DimStation
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dbo.DimStation
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'DimStation',
    DATA_SOURCE = [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net],
    FILE_FORMAT = [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
)
AS
SELECT
    [station_id] AS [station_id],
    [name] AS [station_name],
    [latitude] AS [latitude],
    [longitude] AS [longitude]
FROM [dbo].[stations];
GO

-- Select top 100 records to verify
SELECT TOP 100 * FROM dbo.DimStation;
GO
```

The `DimStation` table remains the same as the one provided in the original code.

3. **Rider Dimension**
This dimension will be used for both the `FactTrip` and `FactPayment` tables to analyze data based on rider-related attributes like age, membership status, and account start date.

```sql
-- Check and create external file format if not exists
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_file_formats WHERE name = 'SynapseDelimitedTextFormat')
CREATE EXTERNAL FILE FORMAT [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
WITH (
    FORMAT_TYPE = DELIMITEDTEXT,
    FORMAT_OPTIONS (
        FIELD_TERMINATOR = ',',
        USE_TYPE_DEFAULT = FALSE
    )
)
GO

-- Check and create external data source if not exists
IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.external_data_sources WHERE name = 'anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net')
CREATE EXTERNAL DATA SOURCE [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net]
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'abfss://anindademo2@anindademo2.dfs.core.windows.net'
)
GO

-- Drop the external table if it exists
IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.DimRider') IS NOT NULL
BEGIN
    DROP EXTERNAL TABLE [dbo].[DimRider];
END

-- Create the external table dbo.DimRider
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE dbo.DimRider
WITH (
    LOCATION = 'DimRider',
    DATA_SOURCE = [anindademo2_anindademo2_dfs_core_windows_net],
    FILE_FORMAT = [SynapseDelimitedTextFormat]
)
AS
SELECT
    [rider_id] AS [rider_id],
    [address] AS [address],
    [first] AS [first_name],
    [last] AS [last_name],
    [birthday] AS [birthday],
    DATEDIFF(year, [birthday], GETDATE()) AS [age],
    [account_start_date] AS [account_start_date],
    [account_end_date] AS [account_end_date],
    [is_member] AS [is_member]
FROM [dbo].[riders];
GO

-- Select top 100 records to verify
SELECT TOP 100 * FROM dbo.DimRider;
GO
```

In this dimension table, we have added a calculated column `age` that determines the rider's age based on their `birthday` and the current date. This will help in analyzing data based on the rider's age at the time of the ride or account start.

With these dimensions in place, you can perform various analyses by joining the fact tables (`FactTrip` and `FactPayment`) with the relevant dimensions. For example:

1. To analyze the time spent per ride based on date, station, rider age, and membership status:
   - Join `FactTrip` with `DimDate`, `DimStation`, and `DimRider`

2. To analyze the money spent per month, quarter, year, and member's age at account start:
   - Join `FactPayment` with `DimDate` and `DimRider`

3. To analyze the money spent per member based on the number of rides and the total duration of rides:
   - Join `FactPayment` with `FactTrip` and `DimRider`

```
Go to the Azure Portal and navigate to your Azure PostgreSQL server instance.
Under the "Settings" section, click on "Connection Security".
Click on the "Add client IP" button on the toolbar (or the "+ Add current client IP address" button).
If your IP address is dynamic and changes frequently, you can add a range of IP addresses that covers your current IP address and potential future IP addresses.
After adding your IP address or range, click "Save" to apply the firewall rule changes.
