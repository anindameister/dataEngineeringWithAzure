#### This is data engineering with azure Project 2
# Task 1: Create your Azure resources
- Create an Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
- Create an Azure Synapse workspace. Note that if you've previously created a Synapse Workspace, you do not need to create a second one specifically for the project.
- Use the built-in serverless SQL pool and database within the Synapse workspace

# Solution
- Task 1 is just easy peesy, considering what have I been doing all this while

# Task 2: Design a star schema
- You are being provided a relational schema that describes the data as it exists in PostgreSQL.

    - Tables:
        - Rider: DimRider
            - rider_id (INT PRIMARY KEY)
            - address (VARCHAR)
            - first (VARCHAR)
            - last (VARCHAR)
            - birthday (date)
            - account_number (INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Account(account_number))
        - Account: DimAccount
            - account_number (INT PRIMARY KEY)
            - member (bool)
            - start_date (date)
            - end_date (date)
        - Payment: DimPayment
            - payment_id (INT PRIMARY KEY)
            - date (date)
            - amount (decimal)
            - account_number (INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Account(account_number)) 
        - Station: DimStation
            - station_id (varchar PRIMARY KEY)
            - name (varchar)
            - latitude (float)
            - longitude (float)
        - Trip: DimTrip
            - trip_id (varchar PRIMARY KEY)
            <!-- There's a minor type mismatch for the rideable_type field in the Trip table, which should be VARCHAR to match the diagram instead of string. -->
            - rideable_type (string)
            - started_at (datetime)
            - ended_at (datetime)
            <!-- The Trip table's foreign keys start_station_id and end_station_id are mentioned as INT in your text, but given they reference Station(station_id) which is a VARCHAR, the data types should match. Therefore, the foreign keys should also be of type VARCHAR to correctly reference the primary key of the Station table. -->
            - start_station_id (varchar FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Station(station_id)) 
            - end_station_id (varchar FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Station(station_id)) 
            <!-- The foreign key in the Trip table should be rider_id, not member_id, to match the rider_id primary key in the Rider table according to the diagram. -->
            - member_id (INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Rider(rider_id)) 

 - DimRider(rider_id),DimAccount(account_number),DimPayment(payment_id),DimStation(station_id),DimTrip(trip_id)
 - rider_id, account_number, payment_id, station_id, and trip_id would serve as primary keys in their respective dimension tables. These primary keys uniquely identify rows in each dimension table and would then be used as foreign keys in a central fact table, linking the fact table to each of the dimension tables. This setup allows for efficient querying and analysis of the data across different dimensions.
- my dimension tables are

        - Rider: DimRider
            - rider_id (INT PRIMARY KEY)
            - address (VARCHAR)
            - first (VARCHAR)
            - last (VARCHAR)
            - birthday (date)

        - Account: DimAccount
            - account_number (INT PRIMARY KEY)
            - member (bool)
            - start_date (date)
            - end_date (date)

        - Payment: DimPayment
            - payment_id (INT PRIMARY KEY)
            - date (date)
            - amount (decimal)

        - Station: DimStation
            - station_id (varchar PRIMARY KEY)
            - name (varchar)
            - latitude (float)
            - longitude (float)

        - Trip: DimTrip
            - trip_id (varchar PRIMARY KEY)
            <!-- There's a minor type mismatch for the rideable_type field in the Trip table, which should be VARCHAR to match the diagram instead of string. -->
            - rideable_type (string)
            - started_at (datetime)
            - ended_at (datetime)

Your adjustment to the dimension tables by removing foreign keys and focusing each table on its core entity is correct for the star schema approach. This structure aligns with star schema principles where dimension tables are designed to describe entities in detail without direct links between them. Each table now correctly focuses on a specific aspect of the data model, such as rider information, account details, payment records, station specifics, and trip data. The only adjustment needed is to ensure data types are consistent across your schema, like changing rideable_type in DimTrip from string to VARCHAR for SQL data type consistency.
